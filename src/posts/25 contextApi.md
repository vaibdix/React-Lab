## Context API

- context api is used to avoid props drilling
- here we have to create a global context/store which will do two things for us:

  - it will store all the data that is required globally
  - it will provide that data throughout the application

- we have to use context api in three steps:

  1. Create the context component

     > First we will store and export the object that is returned by `createContext()` method

     ```jsx
     export let context = createContext(); // it returns an object
     ```

     > We will provide the _data_ as a value to the props.children using context.provider

     ```jsx
     <context.Provider value={data}>{props.children}</context.Provider>
     ```

  2. Connect your AppContext with the entire app

     - we want the context to be available throughout the application and for this we have to wrap app.jsx component call in b/w `<AppContext></AppContext>`

     ```diff
     + always `main.jsx` me ja k `app.jsx` ko wrap karna, so that context/store throughout the app kaam kre like this ⬇️
     ```

     ```jsx
     <AppContext>
       <App />
     </AppContext>
     ```

  3. Use data provided by the context in any of the child components throughout the application

     - to use data provided by the context, we have to use a hook called `useContext()`
     - `useContext()` hook will ask for an argument which should be the context object variable that is being exported from appcontext
     - once we use `useContext()` hook and pass the context object argument, useContext hook will return values provided by the appcontext. we can store the returned values and we can use it

- ### We can have multiple components in a single file.

- ### It is not compulsory to keep the name of component and filename same

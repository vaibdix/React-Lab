## Data Flow

- we know that we can pass data from a `parent component` ---> `child component` using _props drilling_

  - Data Flow is unidirectional by default.

- But it is also possible to pass data from a `child component` ---> `parent component` using props:

  - using useState() hook and a single variable (see DataFlowEx1).

  - using _callback function_ (see Ex2_stateLifting). This process is called `state lifting`.

  - This implies bidirectional data flow b/w components is possible

- `State Lifting` is a technique where data is moved up from child component to parent component `using callback fn` and props.

```diff
- Bi-directional data flow is not recommended
+   because it can lead to complexity in debugging and managing state
```

# React Form Handling - 20 Dec 2024

### Single Input

- Handle a single input field in a form.

### Multiple Input

- More complications arise when handling multiple inputs, such as managing multiple states and handling updates for each input.

### Multiple Users

- More complications occur when dealing with multiple users. Managing user data across different states and handling form submissions can become more complex.

### Prevent Default Behavior of Form

- Preventing the default form submission behavior is essential when using React to handle forms. This can be done using the `event.preventDefault()` method.

### Example:

```javascript
const handleSubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  // Form submission logic here
};
```
